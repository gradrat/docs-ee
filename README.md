# docs-ee: Pracitcal Guidance and Advice for Being A Productive EE

* Read the documentation: https://ee.gradrat.com

## About

This is the documentation source for a set of guides, examples, and best practices regarding various topics to being an Electrical Engineer (EE). The documentation is meant to provide some practical *know-how* for CAD tool usage, design methodologies and best practices. Since this was born out of the experience of several former grad students, it also aims to provide other resources for completing a EE graduate degree (M.S./Ph.D.). Although the original intention was to provide a shared pool of resources for graduate students and educators to use, professionals will likely also find this information useful.
