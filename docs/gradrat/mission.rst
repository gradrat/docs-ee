The mission of this documentation project is to provide better resources for the practical skills that are often the bottleneck of getting research (and work) done for graduate students in the EE field. 

It is not uncommon for students to spend several years getting trained by their advisors in some fundamental skill sets before becoming productive. Often times the domain knowledge of senior students departs when they graduate, leaving advisors with the task of training a new set of students.

The goal of this project is to retain all of the 'common' knowledge typically required for such research and document it in a way that will hopefully accellerate students' ability to become productive and successful.
